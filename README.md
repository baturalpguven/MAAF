# AI-Driven Furniture Assembly Tracking System

Term project for 3D data collection using Intel Realsense stereo cameras and ROS system to understand furniture assembly by analyzing human actions and mistake detection.

## Project Overview
This project designed to detect furniture assembly actions and identify any mistakes in the process. This project offers two distinct solutions:

1. **ResNet + LSTM Model**: A robust approach that combines ResNet with LSTM for sequential data handling.
2. **Custom Lightweight Model**: A tailored, efficient model designed for lighter computational needs.

## Features
- **Dual Model Approach**: Choose between a high-performance or a lightweight model depending on your system's capabilities.
- **Error Detection**: Automatically detects mistakes during the furniture assembly process.
- **Integration Ready**: Incorporates foundational models like Co-Tracker and DEVA for easy integration and adaptability.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for immediate implementation with minimal setup required.

## Demo Videos
Below are the demo videos showcasing both models in action:
